This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), therefore using the configurations and build tool implemented in Create React App.<br>
You can `eject` to set your own configuration choices and build tool. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

```
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
